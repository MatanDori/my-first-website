        <h1>More information</h1>
        <p>
            The Salamander family, which includes several different species and is common in Western Asia, Europe and North Africa. 
            The length of the fonts of mature salmon reaches about 30 inches. The venom gland has been in the front of their skull, in the eye area. 
            They have a rounded tongue and Latin Sub -shaped dental columns, when they serve as their effective hunting tool, along with a good camouflage,
             which allows them to effectively hunt small animals, such as insects and mice. The origin of the name Salmanhara came from the Persian language. 
             The word Salamanhara means "BAA". Indeed, in ancient mythologies of various peoples, such as Greek mythology, Roman mythology  and even in the Jewish Talmud,
             the Salmanders have been linked to the fire. They are mentioned over and over again as fire -related. The Greeks, for example, describe the Salmandra as a fire-fire or flame. 
            Ancient cultural researchers hypothesize that the ancient connection between the Salmanders and the fire was because of their intense colors.
            By the way, the heads of the Salamandra are a fascinating practice in which they devour each other to survive, even before they were born. 
            This is part of a relatively rare phenomenon of intravenous cannibalism (intrauterine cannibalism). And it is important not to be confused - there are some bilateral species in the world
            who are accidentally called "Salmans", such as the Chinese giant Salman and Salman of the Italian tunnels, but they do not belong to the Salmandar family.

      h2>Teritorial Behavior</h2>
       <p>
        The salamanders are nocturnal, and during the rainy season they are active on cool and humid and even very rainy nights. 
        Therefore, they can be easily found on the appropriate nights. In the summer they disappear completely, and they migrate to hidden,
        cool and humid areas such as caves, ravines, rock crevices and more. Not much is known about their life in the dry seasons.
        The diet of adult salamanders includes many invertebrates - insects, arthropods, worms, nudibranchs and terrestrial isopods. 
        The tadpoles feed on crustaceans, snails (mainly the brook snail) and mosquito larvae, and they are used as a natural exterminator.
        Salamanders belong to the tailed series in the amphibian class, along with newts and the like. The tails have a body structure more reminiscent of lizards than frogs and toads, 
        and the tail is considered a more "ancient" feature. That is, the loss of the tail among adults in frogs and toads 
        (the tailless series, which has many more species) occurred at a later stage in the evolution of modern amphibians. 
        This does not mean that salamanders are more "primitive" than frogs, but that the body shape is more preserved compared to the ancestors of today's amphibians.
