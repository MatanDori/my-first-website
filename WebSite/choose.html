            Since the 80s of the 20th century, there has been a dramatic decline in amphibian
            populations worldwide. About a third of the species are currently in danger of extinction,
            and since 1980, 9 species have become completely extinct.
        </p>
            <h3>There are various reason for it:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Invading species. Some of the invasive species are predators of the amphibians, compete with them for their food or transmit pathogens.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Overexploitation of amphibians. Until 1995, about 200 million frogs were exported from Asia to the food industry every year.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Destruction, fragmentation and modification of habitats. Changes caused by humans to the habitat of the amphibians cause the loss of 
                    habitats and breeding sites. A lot of damage was caused mainly by the drying of moist habitats due to pumping and diversion of waterways.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Climate change. Global warming may impair the timing of the amphibians' reproductive cycle and increase their susceptibility to disease.
                </li>
                <li>
                    UV radiation. Fresh water tends to effectively absorb UV radiation, so the inhabitants of these habitats are particularly sensitive to
                    climate change and an increase in UV radiation. UV radiation can not only kill amphibians, but also increase their sensitivity to 
                    pollutants and pathogens. The main damage is in the young stages of their life cycle (egg and tadpole).
                </li>
                <li>
                    pollutants. The moist skin of amphibians is very permeable to many substances, including pesticides, insecticides,
                    herbicides and fertilizers, all of which have been found to be dangerous to amphibians.

                </li>
                <li>
                    Fungal diseases. The fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis causes a skin disease called chytridiomycosis. 
                    The disease is widespread in many regions of the world, spreads rapidly, affects many species of amphibians and causes high mortality rates.
