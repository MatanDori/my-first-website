        <h1>More information</h1>
        <p>
            Each species of frog has typical poetry. According to poetry, the female identifies the males. With the arrival of the female, the male hugs her and rides her back. 
            The female casts large eggs, where thousands of eggs. The male secretes his sperm cells in coordination with the female's eggs. The fertilization is done in the water -external fertilization.
            The eggs remain in the water and the fetus develops in content. After about seven days, the top eggs that grow for about two months in water are arranged with a gradual change of shape. 
            At the end of the process, they develop legs "lose" the tail and become small frogs. The heads are vegetarian, while the graduates are caring for small animals such as crabs, insects and snails.
            The stream frogs come to sexual maturity at the age of two. The frogs play an important role in maintaining ecological balance because they destroy various water insects and especially mosquito caterpillars and pills.
            Their enemies are many: snakes, birds and small mammals, and in some people as well.

       <h2>Teritorial Behavior</h2>
       <p>
           In frogs, male territorial behaviour is often observed at breeding locations; calling is both an announcement of ownership of part of this resource and an advertisement call to potential mates. 
           In general, a deeper voice represents a heavier and more powerful individual, and this may be sufficient to prevent intrusion by smaller males. Much energy is used in the vocalization and it
           takes a toll on the territory holder who may be displaced by a fitter rival if he tires. There is a tendency for males to tolerate the holders of neighbouring territories while vigorously 
           attacking unknown intruders. Holders of territories have a "home advantage" and usually come off better in an encounter between two similar-sized frogs. If threats are insufficient, chest to chest tussles may take place.
           Fighting methods include pushing and shoving, deflating the opponent's vocal sac, seizing him by the head, jumping on his back, biting, chasing, splashing, and ducking him under the water.

       <h2> Area of Living</h2>
       <p>
        The distribution of frogs and toads is very wide; They can be found in different concentrations in almost all regions of the earth, with the exception of Antarctica and most of the islands in the oceans. 
        The greatest diversity of the tailless is found in the rain forests and other areas where a tropical climate prevails. This is because water, which is essential for the existence of most tailless species,
        is abundant in these areas. Some species of the tailless grow in arid areas, such as deserts, where water is not common. These species have adapted over the years to these terrain conditions and have
        developed unique behavioral and physiological traits that help them in this climate. For example, some species dig a burrow under the hot sand and stay there for a long time (for example, rhinophores):
        during the dry season they hibernate, and when it rains they emerge from the burrow, find a puddle or a small lake and reproduce. In these species the development of the egg and the tadpole is very fast
        compared to the other tailless ones, as they must have enough time to become adults before drying out of the few water bodies. In contrast to them, there are species, such as the tree frog, that are adapted
        to the cold and live in the Arctic Circle. These species also hide under the surface of the ground, and most of their bodies enter a stasis-like state.
