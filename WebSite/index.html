            <b>Amphibians</b> are vertebrants that in their yougth live in a fresh
            water and in adulthood are able to exist outside of water as well.
            The first amphibians evolved as the devonian from fish with fleshy
            fins that had lungs and bony fins, features that were useful 
            for adapting to life on land. Over time they split and diversified.
            They became dominant in the Carboniferous and permian periods,
            but were eventually replaced by reptiles and other wertebrates.
            At the same time, their size bacame smaller and diversity decreased,
            until finally only one subclass survive: extant amphibians.  
        </p>

        <h2><big>Evolution</big></h2>
        <p class="Evolution">
            At the beginning of their lives, after breaking out from the eggs they live inside the water, 
            just like fish. They breath oxygen like fish, through their gills, when it is dissolved in water.
            At younghood, amphibian won't survive more than a few miniutes ot of water.
            Since he unable to breath oxygen from the air in his stage, it will simply suffocate.
            Only after the reincarnation, when it matures and change his internal and external, it acend to land.

                        Their bodies are elongated and thin, their legs are short and equal, and their tails are long.
                        Due to their moist skin, their maximum suitability is for habitats close to water reservoirs, 
                        or in habitats where the humidity is relatively high. Some of the species live mainly
                        in an aquatic environment, some enter and leave the water alternately, 
                        and the other part live on land throughout their entire lives as adults.
